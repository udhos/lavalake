# lavalake

Manage security groups uniformly across multiple cloud providers.

- Fetch a security group from a cloud provider and save it as YAML file.
- Can edit the file locally then send it back to the cloud provider.
- Can write the security group rules to cloud provider as another group.
- Can send the security group to another cloud provider, unless the group rules use features unsupported by target provider.
